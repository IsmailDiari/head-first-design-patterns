## Description

This is a repository of the descriptions, UML class diagrams and examples of the
design patterns, based on the 'Head First Design Patterns' book but adapted to
C# language (.NET 5).

## Table of Contents

* [Behavioral Patterns](desctiption/BehavioralPatterns.md)
* [Creational Patterns](desctiption/CreationalPatterns.md)

# Class Diagrams

The [UML Class Diagrams](docs/HeadFirstDesignPatterns.asta) were built with Astah UML.

# Project Principles

The design patterns are guided by following principles:

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separete them from
what stays the same.
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
3. Favor composition above inheritance (HAS-A can be better than IS-A).
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
5. Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

# Design Patterns

| Padrão | Descrição |
|-|-|
| **STRATEGY** | It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. |
| **OBSERVER** | It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. |
| **DECORATOR** | It attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. |
