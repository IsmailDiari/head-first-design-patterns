# Creational Design Patterns

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that
deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner
suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in
design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns
solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas.

* One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system use.
* Another is hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and
combined.
